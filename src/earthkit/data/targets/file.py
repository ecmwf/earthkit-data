    File target.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    file: str, file-like, None
        The file path or file-like object to write to. When None, tries to guess the file name
        from the ``data`` if it is passed as a kwarg.
        When the file name cannot be constructed, a ValueError is raised.
        When ``file`` is a path, a file object is automatically created and closed when the target is closed.
        When ``file`` is a file object, its ownership is not transferred to the target. As a consequence,
        the file object is not closed when the target is closed, even if :obj:`close` is called explicitly.
    append: bool
        If True, the file is opened in append mode. Only used if ``file`` is a path.
    **kwargs:
        Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class.

    Raises:
    -------
    ValueError: If the file name is not specified and cannot be constructed.
