Welcome to earthkit-data's documentation
======================================================

.. warning::

   This project is in the **BETA** stage of development. Please be aware that interfaces and functionality may change as the project develops. If this software is to be used in operational systems you are **strongly advised to use a released tag in your system configuration**, and you should be willing to accept incoming changes and bug fixes that require adaptations on your part. ECMWF **does use** this software in operations and abides by the same caveats.

**earthkit-data** is a format-agnostic Python interface for geospatial data with a focus on meteorology and
climate science. It is the data handling component of :xref:`earthkit`.

**earthkit-data** makes it simple to read, inspect and slice data from a wide range of
geospatial input types (:ref:`grib`, :ref:`netcdf` and more) and transform them into
familiar scientific Python objects (including numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, xarray datasets).

.. code-block:: python

    data = earthkit.data.from_source("file", "my-data.nc")
    arr = data.to_numpy()
    df = data.to_pandas()
    dataset = data.to_xarray()


**earthkit-data** provides additional convenient methods for quickly inspecting certain
features of your input data, such as data dimensionality, axes, coordinate
reference systems and bounding boxes.
